# Calcs for word
## To do
- support for greek: for some reason definitions isnt picking this up
- support for units and avoiding loosing spaces: delete only th bits that are required on RHS 
- support for squares: replace with formatted text during input/output
- add a button to just calculate section: simple change to how the input is handled
