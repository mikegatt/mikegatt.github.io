# Easycalc
## To do
- support for greek: for some reason definitions isnt picking this up
- support for units: try integrating js-quantities or unitsnet-js, see how handcalcs does this?
- support for squares: need to work out how word handles superscripts and tell it to convert that to a square
- decent error handling: write out the errors inline
- avoid getting rid of tab spaces after colons - change regex and check trims
- sections handling: could give each variable a section reference and have some hidden text that splits these out? Each section could have a different dataframe?
